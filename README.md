This project simulates an airport. In which the program is able to calculate the amount of time remaining until a landing slot gets free or giving directly any free slot to the planes.
Within the "data" folder, there are 3 dataframes, where hypothetical infomation about the planes timetable is saved.
Whitin the "entities" folder there are 3 main files: 
1-Lector.py- Here is where all dataframes are procesed. 
2-Slot.py- Where all the slots of the airport are given to the planes based on the information within the dataframes.
3-Aeropuerto.py- Where most of the project logic is saved.
